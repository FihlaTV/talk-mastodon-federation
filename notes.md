# Federate you, federate me

What's the thing that Facebook and Twitter will never do?

Stop vendor locking their platforms.

Open source their algorithms.

Care for their users data.

> I chose to not further talk about these topics,
As developers of software, platforms and networks,
as humans with a written down history of the world,
we should know that knowledge means power, and that power in the hand of the few and priviledged is a bad idea.


## Let me tell you a secret

Open source, decentralized social networks are already walking among us!

# Mastodon

One of the new kids on the block is Mastodon.
- created when?
- for what purpose?
- what's special

## What does it look like?

## Culture on Mastodon
- awoo and birdsite
- bots

## How does it work?
- Host your own server
- follow people on other servers
- follow hashtags

## But how does that work?
Through federation protocols


# The federation
A suite of standards based protocols, some of which recently got acknowledged by the W3C and are now recommendations.

ActivityPub (and ActivityStreams)

Webfinger


HTTP Signatures
Linked Data Signatures

OStatus

Salmon
Portable Contracts
Atom
Atom ActivityStreams
Atom threading
PubSubHubbub (now called WebSub)
